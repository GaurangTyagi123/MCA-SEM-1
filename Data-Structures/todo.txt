*:  Insertion and deletion.

*: Find the middle node of the linked list.

*: Find the nth node from the last.

*: Reverse the linked list.

*: Find the intersection of the linked list.

*: Delete all occurrences of a given key (Example : Delete all node with 6 as data).

*: Split a linked list into 2 list such that First list must contain the all nodes with even places and Second list must contain all the nodes with odd places.

*: Sum of 2 numbers where digits of each number is stored in nodes of the linked list.

*: Check if linked list has loops.

*: Merge 2 linked list.

*: rearrange linked list so that all the odd numbers come first then even
    * e.g. : 1->4->2->5->3->6 becomes 1->5->3->4->2->2->6

*: n queue in an array

*: queue using stack

*: find min,max from an array with least time complexity
